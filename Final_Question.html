<p><b>What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?</b><br>
  Previously, I did take a computer programming class at high school, so I 
  did know about CSS, HTML and Python in basic level. I can create a basic
  website using HTML and CSS. However, I didn't know anything about JavaScript yet.</p>
  
<p><b>Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch?</b><br>
  I built my portfolio from scratch that why I think my portfolio is really simple,
  not fancy like others because I want to practice it by my own.</p>
  
<p><b>What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)</b><br>
   I think the most challenging part of my portfolio is the contents. It’s difficult
  to get clarity around what I'm doing in my practice and estimating the amount of
  content that I need is tough. Sometimes it’s not only an issue of writing content
  but also an issue of organizing content using CSS.<p>
  
<p><b>How taking this class changed your view on Web Development?</b><br>
  Before, I started this class with the thought of acquiring some more knowledge
  on how to be a web developer, but now I want to be more professional in it. </p>
<p><b>What would you recommend to future students taking this class?</b><br>
  Yes, why not. This class is really interesting and I got a lot of knowledge from this 
  class.</p>
